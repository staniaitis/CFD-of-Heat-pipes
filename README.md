# CFD-of-Heat-pipes

This project involves a comprehensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of various heat sink geometries under different flow conditions using ANSYS Fluent. The objective was to study and compare the thermal and flow performance of multiple heat dissipation models by varying factors such as:

1. Flow velocity

2. Inlet temperature

3. Material thermal conductivity

4. Fins shape and spacing

# Key Highlights:
Simulated laminar and turbulent flow regimes

Evaluated temperature distribution, heat transfer coefficients, and pressure drop

Performed mesh independence tests for model accuracy

Identified optimal configurations for enhanced thermal performance

This project demonstrates practical application of CFD tools for thermal system design and performance optimization.
